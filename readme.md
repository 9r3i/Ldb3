This is the 3rd one, but this project is discontinued.

I have the API for this class, no matter it is stopped in build-up, but I think maybe someone out there needs a database class like this. Just take alook to the file: Ldb3-api.txt or Ldb3-api.md

Feel free to use this class, but if you wanna use this class, please remind the license. Thank you.
